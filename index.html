                    Income-tax is levied on the annual income of a person. The year under the Income-tax Law is the

                    classifies the year as (1) Previous year, and (2) Assessment year.

                    e.g., Income earned during the period of 1st April, 2021 to 31st March, 2022 is treated as income of
                    the previous year 2021-22. Income of the previous year 2021-22 will be charged to tax in the next
                    year, i.e., in the assessment year 2022-23.​
